		  <p>
			Thanks for stopping by! I'm a Senior Computer Science major at the University of Notre Dame. Growing up, I was always 
			fascinated by how computers could help people be so much more efficient. That fascination turned into curiosity and soon 
			enough, I became determined to immerse myself in the world of computers to have a better understanding of how it all works. 
			Through taking on my course load, teaching teenagers how to program, and interning at both a startup and a large corporation, I feel that I have 
			grown substantially in that understanding. Now as I embark on my final year of studies, I am searching for opportunities to begin my full-time career in technology. 
			Overall, my goal has has always been to apply my skills and knowledge to the real world to help make the 
			lives of others easier. I want to contribute to a future that will fascinate the next generation. I know the journey has 
			still just begun and it calls for a lot of hard work and perseverance, but it is the journey of my dreams.

		<h4 align="left">Microsoft</h4>
		<h5 align="left"><i>Software Engineering Intern</i><h5> 
		<h6 align="left">June - August 2019</h6>
		<br/>
		<p>
				I am working on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview" target="_blank">Azure Active Directory B2C</a> product team in Mircosoft's Identity Division. Currently I am developing a full stack QuickStart

		<h4 align="left">X2AI</h4>
		<h5 align="left"><i>Spring Tech Intern</i><h5> 
		<h6 align="left">January - May 2019</h6>
		<br/>
		<p>
				X2AI is a startup in San Francisco that strives to provide affordable mental health care through chatbots that 
				have helpful conversation abilities developed with the assistance of professional psychologists. Here I utilized Python and mySQL
				to fix bugs and add features on the backend side of the platform. My biggest contribution was developing a groupchat feature
				that allowed for a group of users to communicate with both each other and a chatbot. Here I had the pleasure of working 
				under <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joey-trevino-5662971/" target="_blank">Joey Trevino</a>, 
				who was the VP of Engineering at the "unicorn" startup Chime. Through him I learned about good software engineering practices and 
				how startups work in general. I also appreciated learning more about mental health awareness from my
				pyschologist coworkers.

		<h5 align="left"><i>Teaching Assistant</i><h5> 
		<h6 align="left">August - December 2018</h6>
		<br/>
		<p>
				My Fall semester of Junior year at Notre Dame I had the privilege of being a Teaching Assistant for professor Corey Pennycuff's 
				C/C++ Programming course. This was a Computer Science introduction course for non Computer
				Science students in the engineering department. My responsibilities were to hold office hours and grade course assigments. 
				Personally I enjoyed helping my fellow students develop in their understanding of
				content from my field of study. For many of my Computer Science classes I would receive a lot of help from office hours
				when I would get stuck on a homework assignment. This was a great opportunity give such help to my fellow students and also to 
				strengthen my understanding of the programming fundamentals. <a href="fa-cse20133-cse20232.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a syllabus for the course if you're curious to learn more about what it covered.

		<h4 align="left">iD Tech Summer Camp</h4>
		<h5 align="left"><i>Lead Instructor</i><h5> 
		<h6 align="left">May - July 2018</h6>
		<p>
				The Summer after my Sophomore year of college I got to teach computer programming lesson plans to adolescents at an ID Tech camp that
				was being held at the University of Houston. This was another opportunity that strengthened my understanding of programming concepts while
				also helping me practice my public speaking skills as I had to present lesson plans to a class full of students. This also helped me develop 
				my leadership skills as I was second-in-command at this camp. It was a lot of responsibility but it was a really enjoyable job as while I was able
				to improve my technical and behavioral skills, I got to introduce technology to the younger generation in a fun and friendly environment.

			The Summer after my Freshman year of college I did a Summer Service Learning Program at the St. Martin's Hospitality Center located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. There I
			worked the frontcounter of the homeless day shelter where I would greet, check-in, and direct clients. This opportunity helped me develop
			my interpersonal skills and taught me a lot about homelessness in the United States. One thing I really treasure about this experience was
			learning the value of talking with and listening to others.

			<h3>CitiBike Web Service Project</h3>
			<p>
			For our Programming Paradigms final project, three classmates and I developed a RESTful JSON web service that would provide users information about CitiBike
			stations (e.g. how many bikes are available, what is the closest station, etc) while also giving them the ability to edit certain information.
			My role on the team focused on developing the Server, which was written in Python using CherryPy. Overall, working on this project was a good experience in working
			with a team and demonstrating many of the concepts learned in this course. The project repository can be seen <a href="https://github.com/msalaman/citibikeproject" target="_blank">here</a>.

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<h3>Databases Food Ordering App</h3>
			<p>
			For our Database Concepts final project, three classmates and I developed a web application in PHP that would work as an ordering platform for the food sale businesses
			that ran in our dormitory. Our application would save user orders in a mySQL database and then make such orders visible to the food sale businesses. The application
			would also make use of past order information to recommend favorite items to users. For this team, my focus was on writing the PHP and figuring out the SQL queries 
			necessary to make this functionality possible. Working on this project provided me a great introduction to SQL and PHP.

			<h3>Student International Business Council Microsoft Project</h3>
			<p>
			My SIBC group was tasked with presenting ideas for how Microsoft could best serve the deskless worker market. Through much research and discussion, our team believed that 
			the best approach for Microsoft would be to use Augmented Reality to serve the manufacturing industry and IoT integration to serve the healthcare industry. My contributinos focused on
			the Augmented Reality portion of presentation which entailed much research on the HoloLens product and the trends of the manufacturing industry. After months of preparation, my team presented
			our solution to a group of Microsoft employees in Redmond, Washington. It was a great opportunity for me to practice my research, teamwork, and public speaking skills. 
			You can see our presentation <a href="SIBCMicrosoftPresentation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

			<br/>

			<br/>
			<h3>Data Structure Twitter API Project</h3>
			<p>
			For our Data Structure Final Project, two classmates and I developed a Python program that would find relevant, connected Twitter accounts for a particular Twitter user. A 
			custom formula was used to determine each Twitter account's value to the user and the accounts were organized using a Max Heap. Working on this project helped me learn how to work
			with Twitter's API and how to apply some Data Structure concepts to real world applications. The project repository can be seen <a href="https://github.com/msalaman/DS-2018-FinalProject" target="_blank">here</a>.

			<h3>Student International Business Council Bosch Project</h3>
			<p>
			My SIBC group was tasked with providing recommendations for Bosch as they are undergoing a digital transformation. Our research led us to believe that Bosch should perform horizontal digital integration, do a 
			combination of insourcing and creating alliances during this transformation, and invest innovation centers. My focus was on the innovation center recommendation so I did a case study
			on how Walmart successfully invested in startups to help their E-commerce division. Our team was able to present our recommendations to a group of Bosch executives in Chicago. I really enjoyed this experience
			and valued being able to practice my research and presentation skills. Our presenation can be seen <a href="SIBCBoschPresentation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

			<h3>Math Gym</h3>
			<p>
			Senior year of High School I developed an Android mobile application for my Independent Study Mentorship class. "Math Gym" serves to encourage users to practice their mental
			math skills which is healthy for the human brain. Working on this app was my introduction to both Java and XML. This was my first big technology project and it helped confirm my
			desire to study Computer Science in college. The app is currently availble on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.math.marcos.myfirstapplication&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>.

			<br/>
			<h3>This Website!</h3>
			<p>
			I made this website using HTML and CSS. It is hosted on github pages. I used Bootstrap to incorporate some slick features.
			Making this website helped me practice HTML and CSS, which I learned in high school in my Web Technologies class but I hadn't
			really applied them ever since. This forced me to do some more research in web development to figure out how to make this
			site look exactly the way I wanted it. Overall, I enjoyed the experience as it helped me improve my web development
			skills and allowed me to express my creativity.
